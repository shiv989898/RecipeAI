### Running the Application

This project requires running two separate development servers: one for the Next.js frontend and one for the Genkit AI flows.

1.  **Start the Genkit development server**:
    Open a terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    This will start the Genkit development UI and watch for changes in your AI flows.

2.  **Start the Next.js development server**:
    Open a second terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Open the app**:
